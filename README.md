This is ludo game that I made.
Upto second commit I have included game ability to play with any numbers of players,
shows game win message and all basic ludo functionalality.
Feel free to check the code files {.h and .c} and ask if you do't understand any 
thing from code.
You can also make your own changes but remember to commit them to not the origin/master branch
but any other branch.

Goal: Probably better if we are able to make it play against computer.
